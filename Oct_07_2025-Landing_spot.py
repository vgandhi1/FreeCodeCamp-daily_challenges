"""Space Week Day 4: Landing Spot
In day four of Space Week, you are given a matrix of numbers (an array of arrays), representing potential landing spots for your rover. Find the safest landing spot based on the following rules:

Each spot in the matrix will contain a number from 0-9, inclusive.
Any 0 represents a potential landing spot.
Any number other than 0 is too dangerous to land. The higher the number, the more dangerous.
The safest spot is defined as the 0 cell whose surrounding cells (up to 4 neighbors, ignore diagonals) have the lowest total danger.
Ignore out-of-bounds neighbors (corners and edges just have fewer neighbors).
Return the indices of the safest landing spot. There will always only be one safest spot.
For instance, given:

[
  [1, 0],
  [2, 0]
]
Return [0, 1], the indices for the 0 in the first array.
