Email Signature Generator
Given strings for a person's name, title, and company, return an email signature as a single string using the following rules:

The name should appear first, preceded by a prefix that depends on the first letter of the name. For names starting with (case-insensitive):
A-I: Use >> as the prefix.
J-R: Use -- as the prefix.
S-Z: Use :: as the prefix.
A comma and space (, ) should follow the name.
The title and company should follow the comma and space, separated by " at " (with spaces around it).
For example, given "Quinn Waverly", "Founder and CEO", and "TechCo" return "--Quinn Waverly, Founder and CEO at TechCo".
